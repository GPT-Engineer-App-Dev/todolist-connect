# todolist-connect

Create a todo app. Tell the implementation to create a simple todo app in its first <implement> request, and when that has succeeded, it should add a footer to the app in the second <implement> request. You should tell the implementation agent all of this in your first message to it. Remind it after it has done the first step.
